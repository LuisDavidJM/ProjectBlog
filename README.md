## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS animations
- CSS tranistions

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to make a completely front end blog template, without back end functionalities, but using different animations and keyframes to give better visual access and internalize a completely google map using iframes to load the map.

### Continued development

Add actions or pages to each of the links in the navbar so that it works like a real blog and can include an api to see information in real time.
